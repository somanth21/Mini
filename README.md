# KhetAI - AI-Powered Farming Assistant

KhetAI is an AI-powered, multilingual web application designed to be a personal farming assistant for Indian farmers.
It provides instant access to crucial information and diagnostics through a simple, conversational interface.


## Overview

The primary goal of KhetAI is to empower farmers by leveraging generative AI to provide timely and accessible information. The application supports multiple Indian languages and offers the following key features:

*   **Conversational AI Agent**: A central, chat-based interface on the homepage where farmers can ask questions in their native language about crop diseases, market prices, and government schemes.
*   **Crop Health Diagnosis**: Farmers can upload a photo of a diseased crop and receive an instant AI-powered diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
*   **Mandi Price Insights**: Get up-to-date market prices for various crops from local markets (mandis), with the location automatically detected or set manually.
*   **Government Scheme Information**: Ask questions about various government agricultural schemes and receive simplified summaries of benefits, eligibility, and application processes.
*   **Multi-language Support**: The entire interface and all AI responses can be translated into several Indian languages.
*   **Persistent User Settings**: User preferences for language and location are saved on the device for a seamless experience.
